    "Of the books I've searched for, Interview with the Vampire has given the best results in terms of what I can eyeball as being similar matches. For that one, it recommended books in the same series, which makes sense. Romance titles appeared to be recommending other romance titles. Big popular books like Harry Potter had trouble getting good recommendations though. It is likely that happened because it's a small user set (80 on the most current run of the model), so it's recommending books based on a very select audience. \n",
    "\n",
    "I tried changing my users sample from those who rated more than 100 books to 200 books and found that the higher number of books gave me better scores. I dropped down to users who rated 50 books and my scores got worse. This was was unexpected because we really do need a larger sample of users here to have more balanced recommendations. It is likely that in this pool of users, going with less of them who rate more books is giving us a more like-minded subset. \n",

If I had more time, I would look at removing non-English titles and would clean out those extra bits to consolidate varying versions of the same title."
