# Book Recommender Engines Capstone Project<br><br>

### Problem Statement 

An independent bookstore is considering having a recommender engine added to their website. They would like a demonstration on what goes into building an engine, as well as a couple examples of the different types available. Two sample book recommender engines were built: one collaborator-based and one content-based. The metric used for evaluation was cosine similarity.
