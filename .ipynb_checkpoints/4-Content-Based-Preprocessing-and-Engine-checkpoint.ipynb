    "I tested the data pulled from preprocessing in the model a variety of ways, seeing which features would give me better scores. For example, I watched for things like whether or not a book from the same series was recommended, if it was part of a series that is. I also watched for age appropriate titles. For example, Interview With the Vampire and If You Give a Mouse a Cookie should not be recommended together based on age-appropriate content. \n",

The scores look great, but on closer look, I wouldn't recommend a children's picture book (If You Give a Mouse a Cookie) to someone reading Interview with the Vampire. And that's only one example of faulty recommending I'm seeing. I think the issue is that with content based engines, we need more data than what I have here in this data set. I think having book descriptions would be a good start. Fuller content paints a better picture of what the book is actually about."

    "Two engines were created based on book data. One was a collaborator engine based on user ratings and the other was a content engine based on product features. Of the two engines, the collaborator engine gave me slightly better recommendations based on book subject matter than the content engine did. The latter gave better scores, but looking closer I can see the subject matter doesn't match up as well. With that in mind, I would recommend a collaborator-based engine, unless you don't have the option to collect a a growing list of user ratings. Then I would suggest a content-based, only I would recommend pulling in more descriptive content and using Natural Language Processing and Word2Vec to assess the relationship between the words and make recommendations based on that.\n",
    "\n",
    "I do see great potential in these engines. Had I more time, the next steps I would have taken and recommend considering are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Collect a larger master data set to test the models on. The bookstore's data would be ideal here. Or, data can be collected via web scraping or an API that includes product descriptions and user reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Something I ran out of time to do was to look into importing foreign language packages. How foreign titles get addressed in the data will need to be something considered for next steps. Either import a package that can handle them, or remove them from the data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. There was some author related data in the Goodreads set that I didn't get a chance to test. I would like to see if that would help with getting getting better recommendations or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Explore options to incorporate consumer usability for the engine by adding a web-based front-end."
